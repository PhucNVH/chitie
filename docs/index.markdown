Chitie stands for `chi tiáº¿t` & `chi tiÃªu` in Vietnamese it means detail on your expenses. 

This is a bot for the Telegram messaging app using their bot platform. It helps you to keep track of your expenses, supporting your financial planning. 
It is simple, like sending a message to a friend on Telegram. No extra application is installed, but it can work on multiple platforms, desktops, and mobiles (like Telegram ðŸ˜Š)

Your data is secured on your server, which is very flexible as you can write your SQL to build reports.

# Usage


Message structure

```
<expense subject: string> <amount: float><transaction_type:enum(â€˜â€™, â€˜câ€™)>
```

There are two types of transactions â€“ debit & credit. In a logging message, if the transaction type is empty, the default value is debit, and if the amount pattern is followed with a c letter, the transaction type is credit.

Example:

Debit expense:
